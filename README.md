# Conway-s-Game-Of-Life
The actual game - https://playgameoflife.com/ 
## Instructions regarding the game:-
1. Start by adding yellow cells manually by left-clicking in the cells or have a random start by pressing 'r' (initially there are no alive cells present).
2. Reset everything by pressing 'q'.
3. Pause the simulation with the spacebar and unpause using the same (cells turn red if the simulation is paused). Initially in a paused state.
4. Run the simulation in a continuous manner or in steps by pressing 'c' (initially in a continuous state).
5. If going by steps then use right arrow ey to move further.
6. I have also added the zoom in, zoom out and dragging features.
